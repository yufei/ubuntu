## the datasource.  Changes to it will not persist across an instance.
## To disable cloud-init's network configuration capabilities, write a file
## /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
## network: {config: disabled}
#network:
#    ethernets:
#        enp0s3:
#            addresses: []
#            dhcp4: true
#            optional: true
#    version: 2
#
#/etc/apt/sources.list
